# Console-Finances

## Description

This financial analysis tool was created for a company so that they are able to analyse their profits and losses over a period of time. This was created using the new skills I have learnt in JavaScript. This includes variable types, for loops and arrays.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the financial analysis tool, you would use this link: https://zubeidadhupli.github.io/Console-Finances/ . If you open the DevTools console, using Command+Option+I for macOS or Control+Shift+I for Windows, you will find the JavaScript running and the result analysis will be displayed. Here is a screenshot of the result ananlysis in the console: ![image of result ananlysis][image/result-analysis.png] .
